# graph-properties-research
Lisp project

This project has been written using Lisp functional language.
There are 3 parts:
1. Graph connectivity - if the graph is connected the spanning tree is shown, otherwise - all the components are shown
2. Bridges and junction vertices searching
3. Finding the euler cycle if the graph is euler
